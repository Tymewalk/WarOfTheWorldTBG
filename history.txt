HISTORY
A small thing of the in-story history.
Times are in Standard Post Units (SPUs). They refer to post numbers.

The year is 2154. Earth is engaged in a deadly, Civilization III-like war.
Many empires have risen and fallen. All that is known is there are only two empires now: The Reds and The Blues.
Both currently control two patches of land - one controls Spain, the other controls Sweden.
They were in peace, until they were provoked, and now they are at war...

SPU 0: The declaration of war was official. Both teams now seek to destroy the other.

13 SPUs later, the war began. Two generals on each side began rallying troops.

At SPU 21, the conquest began. Red had moved their forces into Portugal and France, whereas Blue set out on conquering Scandanavia. Both sides were destined to collide soon.
A third general had joined The Blues at this time.

At SPU 23, The Reds seized control of Germany and Italy.

At SPU 44, The Reds invaded and seized Slovenia, the Czech republic, and Austria. They now surround Switzerland fully.
(Note: Blue Team's actions are currently backlogged and will be filled in here later.)
