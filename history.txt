HISTORY

A small thing of the in-story history.

The year is 2154. Earth is engaged in a deadly, Civilization III-like war.

Many empires have risen and fallen. All that is known is there are only two empires now: The Reds and The Blues.

Both currently control two patches of land - one controls the USA, the other controls Mongolia.
