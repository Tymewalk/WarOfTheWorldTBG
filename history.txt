HISTORY
A small thing of the in-story history.
Times are in Standard Post Units (SPUs). They refer to post numbers.

The year is 2154. Earth is engaged in a deadly, Civilization III-like war.
Many empires have risen and fallen. All that is known is there are only two empires now: The Reds and The Blues.
Both currently control two patches of land - one controls Spain, the other controls Sweden.
They were in peace, until they were provoked, and now they are at war...

SPU 0: The declaration of war was official. Both teams now seek to destroy the other.

13 SPUs later, the war began. Two generals on each side began rallying troops.

At SPU 21, the conquest began. Red had moved their forces into Portugal and France, whereas Blue set out on conquering Scandanavia. Both sides were destined to collide soon.
A third general had joined The Blues at this time.

At SPU 23, The Reds seized control of Germany and Italy.

At SPU 44, The Reds invaded and seized Slovenia, the Czech republic, and Austria. They now surround Switzerland fully.

Shortly after, at SPU 47, The Reds took Morocco. Only 1 SPU later, The Blues took Russia. Many noted this as the beginning of the great race to conquer the continents.

For a short while, there was quiet on the battlefronts as generals went to discuss their next course of action.

At SPU 69, the Blues used Russian tanks to conquer Ukraine. This was the beginning of the soon-to-come war in the Baltics over control of Asia.
Seeing this, 1 SPU after, the Reds responded by moving an Austrian tank into Hungary, thus capturing it.

At SPU 81, General TBGChildGamer officially gained independence from Blue Team and formed Green Team in Alaska. With 5 foot units and a whole world to explore, s/he was certain to find new refuge.

A mere 5 SPUs later, Green Team conquered Canada. Historians marked this as the beginning of TBGChildGamer's conquest throughout the Americas, running mostly unchallenged.
4 SPUs later, The Reds began militarizing their control over Eastern Europe. They conquered Romania and quickly began blockading the advancement of The Blues. Using their spare troops they conquered nearby nations of the United Kingdom and Switzerland.

At SPU 92, Red Team slowly crept downward with their new-claimed territory of Romania. They obtained control of Bulgaria and began stockpiling military near Ukraine, on the cutting edge of the Blue Team's forces.
1 SPU before, Green Team took both Greenland and the USA. Red Team no longer had one front to fight on anymore.
1 SPU after, Red Team took control of Algeria.

Over the course of the next few turns, Green Team ran completely unopposed throughout the Americas. Having seized Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela, a strong foothold was gained within the Americas that alowed Green Team a heavily fortified base.
Meanwhile, Red Team began their conquest throughout Africa. Under General Tymewalk's command, they moved units into Libya and the Western Sahara, nearly ensuring that the tipping point of Egypt would be theirs. They also fortified their position in the Baltics by reinforcing Bulgaria and capturing Turkey.
