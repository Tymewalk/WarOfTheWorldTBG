HISTORY
A small thing of the in-story history.
Times are in Standard Post Units (SPUs). They refer to post numbers.

The year is 2154. Earth is engaged in a deadly, Civilization III-like war.
Many empires have risen and fallen. All that is known is there are only two empires now: The Reds and The Blues.
Both currently control two patches of land - one controls Spain, the other controls Sweden.
They were in peace, until they were provoked, and now they are at war...

SPU 0: The declaration of war was official. Both teams now seek to destroy the other.

13 SPUs later, the war began. Two generals on each side began rallying troops.
