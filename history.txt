HISTORY
A small thing of the in-story history.

The year is 2154. Earth is engaged in a deadly, Civilization III-like war.
Many empires have risen and fallen. All that is known is there are only two empires now: The Reds and The Blues.
Both currently control two patches of land - one controls Spain, the other controls Mongolia.
Nobody knows how it will turn out, but hopefully one team will rise above all...
