[h]War of the World III (Beta)[/h]
[i]Uncharted Territory[/i]

This is a reboot of my War of the World TBG. Both previous ones failed due to a number of reasons. This one attempts to fix a few, rebalance gameplay, and reduce the workload on both players and me, the GM.

Right now, this is a beta. It may not get quick updates, it may change things, and it most likely will not be very balanced.

[b]Wait, "beta"? What and why?[/b]
This is a thread where we'll attempt to play a game using the rules here. This game will end prematurely as I'm just using it to test balancing and such.
The real thread will be posted at the end when this "game" is over.
Additionally, rules may change at any time during this (for balancing). This will not happen in the real game.

What are the changes? I'll show you.
(Or, skip to the end and read the quick list of everything I did.)

[i]DISCLAIMER: This RP is entirely fictitious. Any resemblance to real wars is purely coincidental, and should be treated as such.[/i]
[i]Players: Let's keep it that way. Don't name yourself something or someone from a real war, and don't do anything that would make it very similar to a real war. This is a game, not a war re-enactment.[/i]
[i](That doesn't mean you shouldn't attack someone because it would look similar, just don't go pretending you're a real war leader.)[/i]

[b]Basic Rules[/b]
[u]The Starting Board[/u]
There are two teams - Red and Blue.
Unlike the previous WotWs, you begin in a country decided by me, the GM.
I'll try to make this country have about the same characteristics on both sides, although Earth isn't a perfect map.
Each team will start off with 3 foot units in that country, and $250 to spend.

[u]Turn Play[/u]
Unlike WotW II, which used a time-based turn system, turns are taken as soon as all parties have taken their moves. This is on a per team basis, not a per person. Your team may make moves without you.

Every turn may consist of the following actions:

- You may buy up to three units, to be placed in any non-empty territory you own (see Units below)
- You may battle twice
- You may move up to four groups of units

At the end of each turn, every team will receive $50.

[u]Taking Actions[/u]
You may freely discuss strategy without it being counted as an action. This is because all actions must begin with >>, like so:
[quote]
>> Buy 3 foot units in Russia.
[/quote]
Actions without this will be ignored, and all actions with this will be taken, so long as they are valid.

Please put all actions into one post, if possible. This way I know I can go ahead and make the next turn.

If you are done with your turn, use ">> Done." You will not be able to use any other actions after this for the current turn.

[i]All of these are done with no exceptions, take-backs, or the like. The only time you may use it without being an action is showing another user.[/i]

[u]Movement[/u]

If a territory is unoccupied, moving units there will cause you to then own that territory.
If a territory is occupied by an enemy, you will do battle (see Battle below).

Units may move across sea routes (dashed lines), or across land borders. You may only move each group of units once per turn.

[u]Battle[/u]
Battle occurs when one team enters another's territory with troops. It is decided by dice rolls.
Every attacking troop rolls their attack amount, then the defending troops roll their defense amount.
If the attack amount is greater than the defense amount minus 10, the troops rolling the lowest are killed first. If it isn't, nothing happens.
If the defenders are still alive, they then roll for attack, and the attackers roll for defense. The process is repeated similarly.
If both sides have troops that are still alive, the attackers retreat. If the defenders die, then the territory is claimed by the attackers.

When the lowest rolling troops are killed first, each has to take D points of damage before they die, where D is the defense they rolled.

[b]Units[/b]
These are units you can buy.

Foot Units - nothing special. Rolls 1d10 to attack, 1d10 to defend. - $50/unit
Strongman - stronger than the average unit. Rolls 1d15 to attack, 1d10 to defend. - $100/unit
Armor - hardier than the average unit. Rolls 1d10 to attack, 1d15 to defend. - $100/unit
Shield - can not attack, but defends quite nicely. All damage goes to these units first. Does not attack, rolls 1d15 to defend. - $75/unit
Scouter - simple unit, easy to buy, and good for early conquest. 1d4 to attack, 1d4 to defend. - $25/unit
Special Forces - heavily trained, super-tough elite units. Rolls 1d20 to attack, 1d20 to defend. - $300/unit
Tank (Special) - a metal box with missiles. Moves like land units except can not move through sea. Rolls 1d20 to attack, 1d20 to defend. - $250/unit

When you buy a unit, the territory the unit is placed into must be:
- Under your control
- Not gained this turn
- Not empty

If you do not specify a place for the unit to be placed, the action will not be counted.

[b]Map Key[/b]
Black dotted line - Sea route (tanks can not move through these)
Solid black line - Land bridge (tanks can move through these)
Colored territory - Claimed by (insert color) team
Darkened colored territory - Empty territory (no units) claimed by team

[u]Special Map Rules[/u]
- Alaska is its own territory.
- Small islands do not count. (Sorry Hawaiian TBGers.)
- Clusters of islands are counted as one country (see the Philippines, Indonesia, etc.)

[u]Sea Routes[/u]
Sea routes can be formed by almost any two countries, as long as there is a valid path across a sea or large body of water between them.

Sea routes will normally form when:
[list=*]
[*] Two allied countries (either under one team or two allied teams) are on good terms and would like a route there
[*] Units are seen moving between the two countries a lot (usually for closer countries)
[*] Both countries are on "good terms" (only for countries which are not owned by anyone)
[/list]

Sea routes will normally disband when:
[list=*]
[*] A country is stuck in a lot of battles (the country shuts down its sea routes to protect those on the other end)
[*] Two countries are using the sea route to do battle a lot (one country shuts down the sea route to protect itself)
[/list]

These are just guidelines, though. However, only two sea routes will be altered per country per turn, and no more than five sea routes will be altered per turn.

[b](After this point you can basically skip everything here, since a lot of this isn't available this early in the game.)[/b]

[b]New Alliances[/b]
[u]New Teams - Separation[/u]
In the middle of a game, you may decide you dislike your teammates' actions. If this is the case, you may choose to separate yourself and create a new team.

This can be done one of two ways - peacefully or by force.

If you wish to separate peacefully, your team can discuss which resources go to you. Your team must give you at least $25 and one piece of land with at least one unit. (You will obtain all the units in the land given to you.)
If they do not wish for you to separate, you may do so forcefully by taking up to four units, moving them into an empty or unoccupied territory, and then claiming a separation. You will gain the units and the unoccupied territory, however, you will not gain any money this way.
In either case, you may not join with another team for three turns.

Peaceful separations may be done under the following conditions:
[list=*]
[*] There are at least two other players on the team
[*] The team owns at least three territories
[*] At least four turns have passed
[*] The team has at least $100
[/list]

Forceful separations may be done under all of the peaceful conditions, and:
[list=*]
[*] At least six turns have passed
[*] The team has at least seven units total
[*] The team owns at least four territories
[/list]

[u]New Alliances - Joining Teams[/u]
If you happen to decide being on your own doesn't work, you can join forces with another team.
You will become a member of that team, and they will gain all of your resources.

To do so, the following conditions must be met:
[list=*]
[*] You have not separated within the last 3 turns (see above)
[*] The other team has not battled with you in the last turn
[/list]

[b]TL;DR: What's changed?[/b]
[list=*]
[*] Shields cost $75 instead of $50.
[*] Scouters have 1d4 rolls instead of 1d5.
[*] Gameplay is based on turns, not on time. (This makes it MUCH easier to manage and also speeds up gameplay when everyone's around.)
[*] Rules are a lot clearer.
[*] No more "fluff", just the game (which should make this easier to manage).
[*] Removed Infiltrator and Nuke.
[*] Sea routes now have some actual rules.
[*] Completely rework separating
[/list]

I myself will be playing on whatever team needs players.
