[big]War of the World II: Rebirth[/big]

DISCLAIMER: [i]This game does not intend, in any way, shape, or form, to resemble the actual World Wars. Any similar-looking elements are purely coincidental.[/i]
PLAYERS: [i]Let's keep it that way. Don't name yourself something from a real war, and don't intentionally recreate real battles. (Coincidence is OK.)[/i]

The year is 2156. After the events of the first War of the World, a second war was initiated. The world, still shaky, must get up and fight if it will overcome this.
This new war promises victory for one and defeat for everyone else. The question is - which one will you get?

[b]The Rules[/b]
Each team starts with 3 foot units. These units are your military power - they conquer, seek, and destroy. All information regarding units is public.

You also have $1,000 to spend. You can buy units with them. Each team gains only $75 each turn, so spend wisely!

[b]Units and Types[/b]
Units may move to and from bordering countries, or across sea routes (see Moving below).

Foot units - nothing special. Rolls 1d10 to attack, 1d10 to defend. - $50/unit
Strongman - stronger than the average unit. Rolls 1d15 to attack, 1d10 to defend. - $100/unit
Armor - hardier than the average unit. Rolls 1d10 to attack, 1d15 to defend. - $100/unit
Shield - can not attack, but defends quite nicely. All damage goes to these units first. Does not attack, rolls 1d15 to defend. - $50/unit
Scouter - quick little guy to buy cheap. 1d5 to attack, 1d5 to defend. - $25/unit
Infiltrator - can pass through enemy terrain, but only if friendly terrain is on the other side. Rolls 1d10 to attack, 1d10 to defend. - $100/unit
Special Forces - heavily trained, super-tough elite units. Rolls 1d20 to attack, 1d20 to defend. - $300/unit
Tank (Special) - a metal box with missiles. Moves like land units except can not move through sea. Rolls 1d20 to attack, 1d20 to defend. - $250/unit
Nuke (Special) - a heavily-armored missile that obliterates all targets. Can travel up to 2 spaces. Uses Nuke-style attack. Rolls 1d20 to attack each unit, rolls 1d30 + 30 to defend. - $1000/unit

[b]Special attack types[/b]
[u]Nuke[/u]
Attacking Nukes may not attack with anyone else.
When Nukes attack, they deal their damage to EVERY unit individually, not the standard way.
However, nukes do not attack first. The defenders deal their damage first, giving a chance to destroy the nuke beforehand.

When you buy, the territory the unit is brought into must be:
- Under your control
- Not gained this turn
- Not empty

[b]Moving[/b]
You may move to any territory connected to you through land, or through sea routes (marked on the map). Special rules are:
[list=*]
[*]Alaska is its own territory. US doesn't claim it.[/*]
[*]Small islands like Hawaii are not counted.[/*]
[*]Canals like the Panama and Suez canals do not block land travel. Tanks can move through them.[/*]
[/list]

[b]Map Key[/b]
Black dotted line - Sea route (tanks can not move through these)
Two black lines - Land bridge (tanks can move through these)
Colored territory - Claimed by (insert color) team
Darkened colored territory - Empty territory claimed by (team)


Some territories are split, but for the sake of clarity, count as one:
[list=*]
[*]Indonesia[/*]
[*]Australia/Tasmania[/*]
[*]New Zealand[/*]
[*]Philippines[/*]
[/list]

[b]Territory[/b]
As mentioned, each team starts with one territory. To conquer more:
- if it is unclaimed ground, simply enter with troops.
- if it is enemy territory that is empty, attack with 5 points or higher. If you fail, your troops retreat.
- if it is enemy territory that is filled with units, defeat the troops there.

If a territory is claimed but empty, it will be marked by a darker shade of the team's color.

[b]Battle[/b]
Battle occurs when one team enters another's territory with troops. It is decided by dice rolls.
Every attacking troop rolls their attack amount, then the defending troops roll their defence amount.
If the attack amount is greater than the defence amount minus 10, the troops rolling the lowest are killed first. If it isn't, nothing happens.
If the defenders are still alive, they then roll for attack, and the attackers roll for defence. The process is repeated similarly.
If both sides have troops that are still alive, the attackers retreat. If the defenders die, then the territory is claimed by the attackers.

When the lowest rolling troops are killed first, each has to take D points of damage to die, where D is the defence they rolled.

For example:

Attacking team sends 3 strongmen to fight 3 foot units.
The strongmen roll 6, 11, and 8 for 25 total damage. The foot units roll 7, 9, and 10, for a total of 26 defence.

Since 25 > 26 - 10, the foot units rolling 7 and 9 are killed. The foot unit rolling 10 survives, as there was not enough damage left to kill him.

The lone foot unit then rolls 6, and the strongmen roll 4, 6, and 3, for a total of 13 defence.
The strongman rolling 3 is killed, but no others are.

Since both sides are still alive, the strongmen (down one member) retreat.

[b]Turns[/b]
Each team may take one turn every 3 hours. Turns are reset at 00:00, 03:00, 06:00, 09:00, 12:00, 15:00, 18:00, and 21:00 each day in UTC time.

In one turn you may:
- Buy up to 3 units
- Move units from one territory to another (you may do this 5 times, see note)
- Battle once

One move counts as moving any number of troops from one territory to another.

For instance, moving 6 troops from Canada to Alaska is one move, but moving 4 more troops from Canada to the USA is a separate move.
You may also not move troops that have already been moved.

Mark your actions like this:
"~~> I buy 3 foot units in Russia."
"~~> I move 1 tank and 1 strongman to Poland."

This WILL signify your action has been taken, and now counts towards the total. Use caution, using it in a post means your action gets taken, whether you like it or not!
You don't have to do everything in one post, in fact, multiple players on one team can act on the same turn.

[b]Other Nations?[/b]
You may conquer new land connected to your team's territory at any time and secede from your main country. In doing so you will recieve 2 foot units and $75.
You may NOT abuse this to gain an advantage. Just because your team is failing does not mean you can just leave and get a fresh start.

[b]Negotiations[/b]
Yes, you can trade units, cash, and territory.
You may NOT trade all your territory.
If you want to trade everything, however, you may surrender to a team.
Surrender is not allowed if:
- You are one of the only 2 teams
- One party is a new nation that was created 10 or less turns ago
- You are attempting to scam for extra units/coins/other advantages

[b]New Stuff[/b]
To fit in with story (and game balance) I may add new stuff.

[b]Fairness Agreement[/b]
By joining this game I agree that I will act fairly among my teammates, cooperate and plan strategy, and will try to effectively play, regardless of my team's current state.
I will not abuse the seceding or surrender features of the game for an advantage, and will use these features politely and properly.

Now that that's out of the way, here is a form:

Team:
Catchphrase (for silliness):
I have read and agree to the Fairness Agreement above.
